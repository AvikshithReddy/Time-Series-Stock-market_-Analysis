Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
yfinance: for fetching historical stock data
mplfinance: for generating professional candlestick charts
scikit-learn: for exploratory scatter analysis
Jupyter Notebook: for structured data storytelling

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed:
Time series analysis of open prices, trading volume, and total capital traded
